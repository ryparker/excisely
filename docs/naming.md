# Excisely — Name & Origin

**Excisely** (ek-SIZE-lee) — AI-powered label verification for the U.S. Treasury's TTB.

---

## The Word

**Excise** is a tax levied on goods produced and sold within a country. In 1791, Alexander Hamilton — the first Secretary of the Treasury — proposed an excise tax on domestically distilled spirits as the young nation's primary revenue source. It was the first time the federal government asserted its authority to inspect, regulate, and put its stamp on alcohol produced in America.

**Excisely** is a portmanteau of **excise** and **precisely** — the AI checks labels with precision, powered by the same regulatory authority Hamilton created 235 years ago.

## Why This Name

### It sits at a unique intersection

The name needed to reflect five things at once:

1. **The action** — checking alcohol labels for regulatory compliance
2. **The institution** — the United States government, specifically the U.S. Treasury
3. **The heritage** — America's rich and turbulent history with alcohol regulation
4. **The department** — TTB (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau), a Treasury bureau
5. **The innovation** — AI modernizing a process that has been manual for decades

"Excise" is the single English word that lives at the intersection of all five. No other word carries the same density of meaning for this specific product.

### The historical throughline

Hamilton's excise tax on whiskey (Revenue Act of 1791) created the **revenue officers** — federal agents who went to distilleries, inspected the product, verified the proof, and marked the barrels. Those revenue officers are the direct ancestors of today's TTB labeling specialists.

The Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 — when farmers in western Pennsylvania refused to pay — was the first test of federal authority under the Constitution. George Washington personally led 13,000 troops to suppress it. The government's right to regulate alcohol was established by force.

That lineage runs unbroken:

```
Hamilton's Excise Tax (1791)
    -> Revenue Officers (1791-1862)
        -> Bureau of Internal Revenue (1862)
            -> ATF (1972)
                -> TTB (2003)
                    -> Excisely (2026)
```

### The phonetic play

Say "excisely" out loud. It sounds like **"precisely"** — which is exactly what the tool does. It precisely verifies that every field on an alcohol label matches its application data. The pun works even for someone who has never heard the word "excise."

### It sounds like software

Invented words with familiar phonetic patterns make strong product names. "Excisely" follows the same linguistic pattern as Spotify, Shopify, Grammarly — a root word modified into something new and ownable. It is:

- Two-and-a-half syllables, rolls off the tongue
- Unique — no other product uses this name
- Memorable — the "precisely" echo sticks
- Searchable — zero competition for the term

### The audience already knows "excise"

TTB labeling specialists work within the excise tax framework daily. For them, "excise" isn't an obscure word — it's foundational vocabulary. The name signals insider knowledge and institutional respect while the "-ly" suffix modernizes it into something that feels like a product, not a policy.
